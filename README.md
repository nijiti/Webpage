The purpose of this projefct is to deliver a up to date website ammending all of the issues that the cilent wanted to be fix for his business.
I built this project to not only deliver the best possible service to my cilent but to also better my skills in front-end web development.
the problems that were fixed during the project were links issues that were arising in the html that wasnt functioning, there was the navigation bar that need fixing into the right postion.
what I learnt from this project is that fronet-end web devlopment is not easy, it takes some time and paitence to get good at it.
